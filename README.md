# Knowledge Mapping and Data Visualization Final Project

  Undoubtedly, the most devastating effect of the Covid-19 pandemic, which affected the whole world, was on the economy. Businesses were closed, people lost their jobs and money. In project, we examined the people who were unemployed due to covid-19 in the light of statistical data. Many specific data such as gender distribution of unemployed people, education levels, unemployment durations are visualized and analyzed in this project. In addition, unemployment rates of the world countries during the pandemic period are another research and data visualization subject of the project.
