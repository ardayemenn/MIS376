As we know, covid-19, which affected the whole world, also greatly affected businesses. 
Affected companies reduced their workforce to reduce their expenses. 
In this project, I will examine the unemployment rate in Turkey.
I will visualize the change in the unemployment rate during the pandemic process.

My biggest challenge will be importing data. I couldn't find an xlsx or cvs file and I have to write the dataset myself.


I get the data for this project from the Turkish Statistical Institution.
